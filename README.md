# MyArrayList
Apocalyptic ArrayList

Common built-in Methods for ArrayLists which we recreated for MyArrayLists:
  * add (int index, T element)
  * add (T element)
  * contains (Object o)
  * get (int index)
  * remove (int index) might have to overload this with remove (T element)
  * size ()
  * toString ()
  * sortList ()
  * filter (T low, T high)
  * merge (MyArrayList <T> paramList)

Other methods which could be considered as an addition
  * clear()  -> remove everything from array list
  * isEmpty()  -> check if array list is empty
  * toArray() -> converts to normal array
  * set(int index, T element)  -> replace object at position
